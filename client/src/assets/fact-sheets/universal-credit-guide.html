        <h1>Universal Credit: A Complete Guide</h1>
        <p>Citizens Information & Advice Bureau | Last Updated: May 2025</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <h2>What is Universal Credit?</h2>
        <p>Universal Credit is a payment to help with your living costs. It's paid monthly (or twice a month for some people in Scotland). Universal Credit has replaced the following benefits:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Child Tax Credit</li>
            <li>Housing Benefit</li>
            <li>Income Support</li>
            <li>Income-based Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA)</li>
            <li>Income-related Employment and Support Allowance (ESA)</li>
            <li>Working Tax Credit</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you currently receive any of these benefits, you cannot claim Universal Credit at the same time. You will be migrated to Universal Credit eventually via a process called "managed migration."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <h2>Eligibility</h2>
        <p>You may be eligible for Universal Credit if:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You're on a low income or out of work</li>
            <li>You're 18 or over (there are some exceptions if you're 16 to 17)</li>
            <li>You're under State Pension age (or your partner is)</li>
            <li>You and your partner have £16,000 or less in savings between you</li>
            <li>You live in the UK</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Your eligibility also depends on where you live, your immigration status, and whether you live with a partner.</p>
        
        <div class="note">
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> If you're in full-time education, you can only claim Universal Credit if certain conditions apply, such as being responsible for a child or having limited capability for work.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <h2>How Much You Can Get</h2>
        <p>Universal Credit consists of a standard allowance and any extra amounts that apply to you. These might include:</p>
        
        <h3>Standard Allowance (Monthly)</h3>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Your Circumstances</th>
                <th>Monthly Standard Allowance</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Single and under 25</td>
                <td>£311.68</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Single and 25 or over</td>
                <td>£393.45</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>In a couple and both under 25</td>
                <td>£489.23 (per couple)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>In a couple and either of you is 25 or over</td>
                <td>£617.60 (per couple)</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        
        <h3>Extra Amounts</h3>
        <p>You may get more money on top of your standard allowance if you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Have children</li>
            <li>Have a disability or health condition which prevents you from working</li>
            <li>Need help paying your rent</li>
            <li>Care for a severely disabled person</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="note">
            <p><strong>Important:</strong> Your payment can be reduced due to earnings, other income, savings over £6,000, or other factors. Universal Credit is typically reduced by 55p for every £1 you earn.</p>
        </div>

    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <h2>Managing Your Universal Credit Claim</h2>
        <h3>Your Claimant Commitment</h3>
        <p>Your Universal Credit claim is based on a 'Claimant Commitment' which outlines what you've agreed to do to prepare for and look for work, or to increase your earnings if you're already working. Your commitment will depend on your circumstances.</p>
        
        <h3>Advance Payments</h3>
        <p>If you need help with your living costs while you wait for your first payment, you can apply for an advance. This is a loan that you must pay back from your future Universal Credit payments.</p>
        
        <h3>Reporting Changes</h3>
        <p>You must report any changes in your circumstances as they may affect your payment. This includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Finding a job or ending employment</li>
            <li>Changes to your income or savings</li>
            <li>Moving home</li>
            <li>Changes to your household (e.g., having a baby, a partner moving in)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <h2>If You Disagree with a Decision</h2>
        <p>If you disagree with a decision about your Universal Credit, you can ask for the decision to be looked at again. This is called a 'mandatory reconsideration'. You must request this within one month of the date on your decision letter.</p>
        
        <p>If you're still unhappy after the mandatory reconsideration, you can appeal to an independent tribunal. Our advisors can help you with this process.</p>
    </div>
