        <h1>Debt Solutions Explained</h1>
        <p>Citizens Information & Advice Bureau | Last Updated: May 2025</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>If you're struggling with debt, you're not alone. Many people in the UK face financial difficulties, but there are solutions available to help you manage your debts and regain control of your finances.</p>
        
        <p>This factsheet outlines the main debt solutions available in England and Wales. Some solutions are different in Scotland and Northern Ireland.</p>
        
        <div class="note">
            <p><strong>Important:</strong> Before deciding on any debt solution, it's advisable to get free, impartial advice from a debt adviser. Our Citizens Information & Advice Bureau offers confidential debt advice tailored to your situation.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <h2>Understanding Your Debt Situation</h2>
        <h3>Priority and Non-Priority Debts</h3>
        <p>Before looking at solutions, it's important to understand the difference between priority and non-priority debts:</p>
        
        <h4>Priority Debts</h4>
        <p>These have serious consequences if not paid and should be dealt with first:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Mortgage or rent arrears</li>
            <li>Council Tax arrears</li>
            <li>Gas and electricity arrears</li>
            <li>Court fines</li>
            <li>TV Licence</li>
            <li>Child maintenance</li>
            <li>Income Tax, National Insurance and VAT</li>
            <li>Hire purchase agreements for essential items</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Non-Priority Debts</h4>
        <p>These still need to be paid, but the immediate consequences of non-payment are less severe:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Credit card debts</li>
            <li>Store cards</li>
            <li>Unsecured personal loans</li>
            <li>Overdrafts</li>
            <li>Water bills (you cannot be disconnected for water debt)</li>
            <li>Money borrowed from friends or family</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <h2>Informal Solutions</h2>
        <h3>Debt Management Plan (DMP)</h3>
        <p>A Debt Management Plan is an informal agreement between you and your creditors to pay off your debts at a rate you can afford.</p>
        
        <h4>Key Features:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>You make one monthly payment which is distributed to your creditors</li>
            <li>Only covers non-priority debts</li>
            <li>Not legally binding</li>
            <li>Can be arranged through a free debt advice agency</li>
            <li>Creditors may agree to freeze or reduce interest and charges</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Suitable If:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>You have spare income after paying priority debts and living costs</li>
            <li>You can make regular payments towards your debt</li>
            <li>Your debt problems are temporary</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Drawbacks:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Creditors don't have to agree to it</li>
            <li>Creditors can still take legal action</li>
            <li>It will take longer to pay off your debts if interest and charges aren't frozen</li>
            <li>It will affect your credit rating</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <h3>Negotiating with Creditors</h3>
        <p>You can contact your creditors directly to explain your situation and try to negotiate a solution, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A payment holiday</li>
            <li>Reduced payments temporarily</li>
            <li>Freezing interest and charges</li>
            <li>Writing off part of the debt (rare, but possible in hardship cases)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="note">
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Always put agreements in writing, keep copies of all correspondence, and make payments as agreed to build trust with your creditors.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <h2>Formal Debt Solutions</h2>
        <h3>Debt Relief Order (DRO)</h3>
        <p>A Debt Relief Order is a formal insolvency procedure for people with limited assets, low income, and relatively low debts.</p>
        
        <h4>Key Features:</h4>

            <li>Recorded on a public register</li>
            <li>Restrictions on obtaining credit and running a business</li>
            <li>Not all debts can be included (e.g., student loans, court fines, child maintenance)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <h3>Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA)</h3>
        <p>An Individual Voluntary Arrangement is a formal agreement between you and your creditors to pay all or part of your debts over a set period, usually 5-6 years.</p>
        
        <h4>Key Features:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Legally binding on you and your creditors</li>
            <li>You make regular payments to an Insolvency Practitioner who distributes them to creditors</li>
            <li>After the IVA period, remaining debts included in the IVA are written off</li>
            <li>Can include most types of debt</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Suitable If:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>You have regular income</li>
            <li>You can afford to make monthly payments</li>
            <li>You have debts over £10,000 (typically)</li>
            <li>You have two or more creditors</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Drawbacks:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Fees for the Insolvency Practitioner (usually taken from your monthly payments)</li>
            <li>Affects your credit rating for 6 years</li>
            <li>May require you to release equity in your home</li>
            <li>Recorded on a public register</li>
            <li>If you fail to maintain payments, the IVA may fail and you could face bankruptcy</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="warning">
            <p><strong>Warning:</strong> Be wary of commercial IVA providers who may charge high fees. Always seek free debt advice first to see if an IVA is right for you.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <h3>Bankruptcy</h3>
        <p>Bankruptcy is a court procedure for people who cannot pay their debts. It's usually considered a last resort when other solutions aren't suitable.</p>
        
        <h4>Key Features:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Your assets may be sold to pay your debts</li>
            <li>Most debts are written off</li>
            <li>Usually lasts for 1 year, after which you're discharged</li>
            <li>Costs £680 to apply (though you can apply for help if you're on a low income)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Suitable If:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>You have no realistic way of paying your debts</li>
            <li>You don't own many assets</li>
            <li>You're unable to make an agreement with your creditors</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Drawbacks:</h4>
        <ul>

            <li>Affects your credit rating for 6 years</li>

        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <h2>Other Options</h2>
        <h3>Administration Order</h3>
        <p>If you have debts totalling less than £5,000 and at least one County Court Judgment (CCJ) against you, you can apply for an Administration Order.</p>
        
        <h3>Breathing Space (Debt Respite Scheme)</h3>
        <p>This gives you 60 days' legal protection from creditor action, during which interest and charges are frozen, and enforcement action is paused. It's designed to give you time to get debt advice and find a solution.</p>
        
        <h3>Full and Final Settlement</h3>
        <p>If you have a lump sum available (perhaps from a windfall or help from family), you can offer creditors a percentage of the debt as a full and final settlement.</p>
