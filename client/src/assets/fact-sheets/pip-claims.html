        <h1>Personal Independence Payment (PIP) Claims</h1>
        <p>Citizens Information & Advice Bureau | Last Updated: May 2025</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <h2>What is Personal Independence Payment (PIP)?</h2>
        <p>Personal Independence Payment (PIP) is a benefit that helps with the extra costs of living with a long-term health condition or disability. PIP is not means-tested, so your income, savings, or whether you're working don't affect your eligibility or payment amount.</p>
        
        <p>PIP has replaced Disability Living Allowance (DLA) for people aged 16 to State Pension age. If you're already receiving DLA, you'll eventually be invited to apply for PIP.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <h2>Eligibility</h2>
        <p>To be eligible for PIP, you must:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Be aged 16 or over</li>
            <li>Have a long-term physical or mental health condition or disability</li>
            <li>Have difficulty with activities of daily living or getting around (or both)</li>
            <li>Have had these difficulties for at least 3 months and expect them to continue for at least 9 months</li>
            <li>Usually be resident in England, Wales, or Scotland</li>
            <li>Be in Great Britain when you claim (with some exceptions)</li>
            <li>Not be subject to immigration control</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="note">
            <p><strong>Important:</strong> You can get PIP whether you're working or not. It doesn't matter if you have savings or if you're getting other benefits.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <h2>PIP Components and Rates</h2>
        <p>PIP has two components:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Daily Living component</strong> - for help with everyday tasks</li>
            <li><strong>Mobility component</strong> - for help with getting around</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>Each component has two rates:</p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Component</th>
                <th>Standard Rate (weekly)</th>
                <th>Enhanced Rate (weekly)</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Daily Living</td>
                <td>£68.10</td>
                <td>£101.75</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Mobility</td>
                <td>£26.90</td>
                <td>£71.00</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        
        <p>The rate you receive depends on how your condition affects you, not on the condition itself.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <h2>How to Apply for PIP</h2>
        <h3>Step 1: Initial Claim</h3>
        <p>Call the PIP claim line on 0800 917 2222 to start your claim. You'll need:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your contact details</li>
            <li>Date of birth</li>
            <li>National Insurance number</li>
            <li>Bank or building society details</li>
            <li>Your doctor or health worker's details</li>
            <li>Details of any time spent abroad, in a care home, or hospital</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Step 2: Complete the 'How your disability affects you' form</h3>
        <p>After your initial call, you'll be sent a form called 'How your disability affects you' (PIP2). This form asks about how your condition affects your daily life, both on good days and bad days.</p>
        
        <div class="note">
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Our advisors can help you complete this form accurately. It's important to provide specific examples of how your condition affects you, rather than just listing your conditions.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Step 3: Assessment</h3>
        <p>Most people will need to attend an assessment with a health professional. This may be in person, over the phone, or by video call. The assessor will ask questions about your condition and how it affects your daily activities.</p>
        
        <h3>Step 4: Decision</h3>
        <p>You'll receive a decision letter that tells you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Whether you'll get PIP</li>
            <li>Which components you'll get (daily living, mobility, or both)</li>
            <li>Which rate you'll get for each component (standard or enhanced)</li>
            <li>How long you'll get PIP for</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <h2>PIP Assessment Criteria</h2>
        <p>The PIP assessment looks at your ability to carry out 12 activities:</p>
        
        <h3>Daily Living Activities</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preparing food</li>
            <li>Eating and drinking</li>
            <li>Managing treatments</li>
            <li>Washing and bathing</li>
            <li>Managing toilet needs</li>
            <li>Dressing and undressing</li>
            <li>Communicating</li>
            <li>Reading</li>
            <li>Mixing with other people</li>
            <li>Making decisions about money</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Mobility Activities</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Planning and following journeys</li>
            <li>Moving around</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>For each activity, you'll be assessed on your ability to carry out the task:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Safely</li>
            <li>To an acceptable standard</li>
            <li>Repeatedly</li>
            <li>In a reasonable time period</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Points are awarded for each activity based on your level of difficulty, and the total determines whether you qualify for each component and at what rate.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <h2>Tips for a Successful PIP Claim</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Be honest about your condition</strong> - Describe how you are on both good and bad days, and explain how often you have bad days.</li>
            <li><strong>Give specific examples</strong> - Rather than saying "I have difficulty cooking," explain exactly what problems you have, such as "I can't stand for long periods to cook" or "I've dropped pans because of poor grip strength."</li>
            <li><strong>Include supporting evidence</strong> - Provide recent medical reports, care plans, or letters from health professionals if you have them.</li>
            <li><strong>Keep a diary</strong> - Record how your condition affects you over a week or two before completing the form.</li>
            <li><strong>Focus on difficulties, not diagnoses</strong> - The assessment is interested in how your condition affects you, not just what conditions you have.</li>
            <li><strong>Get help with your claim</strong> - Our advisors can help you complete the form and prepare for assessments.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <h2>If You Disagree with the Decision</h2>
        <p>If you're unhappy with the decision on your PIP claim, you can:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Request a mandatory reconsideration</strong> - This asks the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) to look at their decision again. You must do this within one month of the date on your decision letter.</li>
            <li><strong>Appeal to a tribunal</strong> - If you're still unhappy after mandatory reconsideration, you can appeal to an independent tribunal. You must do this within one month of the mandatory reconsideration notice.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <div class="note">
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> Success rates for appeals are high when claimants provide additional evidence and attend their hearing in person. Our advisors can help you prepare for and represent you at appeal hearings.</p>
